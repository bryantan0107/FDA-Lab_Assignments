    "# Task 1 - Apriori Algorithm for Recommender System (33 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Definition:** In this programming assignment, you are required to implement the Apriori algorithm and apply it to mine frequent itemsets for recommendation. You are required to implement the algorithm from scratch by using only native Python libraries and NumPy. For efficiency you will need to convert the items to ids and sort them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** The provided input file (`video_games.txt`) contains the favourite video games of 4096 users. Each line in the file corresponds to a user and represents a list of video games the user likes. An example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Torchlight 2;Transistor*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the corresponding user likes the video games \"Torchlight 2\" and \"Transistor\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** You need to implement the Apriori algorithm and use it to mine frequent itemsets. Set the relative minimum support to 0.055 and run the algorithm on the 4096 lists of video games. In other words, you need to extract all the itemsets that have an absolute support larger or equal to 226."
